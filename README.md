## Project title
Use Node-Express to interact with a mySQL database.

## Motivation
I have already used MongoDB in many past projects, but never tried making something that used a mySQL server.

## Features
Going to try organizing my node server folders/files on how Express created the architecture.

## Code Example
TBD

## Installation
'npm run install-project' to install all Javascript dependencies.

## How to use?
'npm start' to start the Node server. Use RESTful api calls to localhost to interact with the mySQL server
